HyperExecute is a smart test orchestration platform to run end-to-end XCUI tests at the fastest speed possible. HyperExecute lets you achieve an accelerated time to market by providing a test infrastructure that offers optimal speed, test orchestration, and detailed execution logs.

Integrating seamlessly into your existing Cypress testing suite, SmartUI SDK revolutionizes the way you approach visual regression testing. Our robust solution empowers you to effortlessly capture, compare, and analyze screenshots across a multitude of browsers and resolutions, ensuring comprehensive coverage and accuracy in your visual testing endeavors.

The overall experience helps teams test code and fix issues at a much faster pace. HyperExecute is configured using a YAML file. Instead of moving the Hub close to you, HyperExecute brings the test scripts close to the Hub!

# How to run Cypress tests through SmartUI SDK on HyperExecute

> SmartUI SDK only supports Cypress versions >= 10.0.0

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
   - [Clone the Sample Repository](#clone-the-sample-repository)
   - [Download HyperExecute CLI](#download-hyperexecute-cli)
   - [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables)
* [Create a SmartUI Project](#create-a-smartui-project)
* [Configure YAML File](#configure-yaml-in-your-test-suite)
* [Execute your Test Suite](#execute-your-test-suite)
* [Navigation in Automation Dashboard](#navigation-in-automation-dashboard)

## Prerequisites

- Login to [HyperExecute](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/) with your credentials.
- Basic understanding of Command Line Interface and Cypress is required.
- Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

### Clone the Sample Repository

Download or Clone the code sample for the Cypress from the LambdaTest GitHub repository to run the tests on the HyperExecute.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/hyperexecute-smartui-sdk-cypress
cd hyperexecute-smartui-sdk-cypress
```

### Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

### Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Create a SmartUI Project

The first step is to create a project with the application in which we will combine all your builds run on the project. To create a SmartUI Project, follow these steps:

1. Go to [SmartUI Projects page](https://smartui.lambdatest.com/)
2. Click on the `New Project` button
3. Select the platform as **CLI** for executing your `SDK` tests.
4. Add name of the project, approvers for the changes found, tags for any filter or easy navigation.
5. Click on the **Submit**.

## Configure YAML in your Test Suite

Here is the sample YAML file for your reference that is being used in this repository.

You need to edit the `PROJECT_TOKEN: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN"` flag and enter your project token that show in the SmartUI app after, creating your project.

```bash
---
version: 0.1
globalTimeout: 90
testSuiteTimeout: 90
testSuiteStep: 90

runson: win

autosplit: true

retryOnFailure: true
maxRetries: 1

concurrency: 1

env:
  CACHE_DIR: m2_cache_dir
  PROJECT_TOKEN: "YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN" #Enter your project token here

cacheKey: '{{ checksum "package.json" }}'
cacheDirectories:
  - node_modules

pre:
  - npm i @lambdatest/smartui-cli @lambdatest/selenium-driver selenium-webdriver
  - npx smartui config:create smartui-web.json

post:
  - cat hyp-smartui-sdk-selenium-javascript.yaml

testDiscovery:
  type: raw
  mode: static
  command: ls sdkCloud.js

testRunnerCommand: npx smartui exec node sdkCloud.js --config smartui-web.json

jobLabel: ["smart-ui-sdk", "hyperexecute", "selenium", "javascript"]
```

## Execute your Test Suite

NOTE: In case of macOS, if you get a permission denied warning while executing CLI, simply run **`chmod u+x ./hyperexecute`** to allow permission. In case you get a security popup, allow it from your **System Preferences** → **Security & Privacy** → **General tab**.

Run the below command in your terminal at the root folder of the project:

```bash
./hyperexecute --config <path_of_yaml_file>
```

OR use this command if you have not exported your username and access key in the step 2.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user <your_username> --key <your_access_key> --config <path_of_yaml_file>
```

e.g.

```bash
./hyperexecute --user user1 --key 12345 --config hyp-smartui-sdk-selenium-javascript.yaml
```

## Navigation in Automation Dashboard

HyperExecute lets you navigate from/to *Test Logs* in Automation Dashboard from/to *HyperExecute Logs*. You also get relevant get relevant XCUI test details like video, network log, commands, Exceptions & more in the Dashboard. Effortlessly navigate from the automation dashboard to HyperExecute logs (and vice-versa) to get more details of the test execution.

Visit the [HyperExecute Dashboard](https://hyperexecute.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute) and check your Job status. 

Visit your SmartUI project to view builds and compare snapshots between different test runs. You can see the Smart UI dashboard to view the results. This will help you identify the Mismatches from the existing `Baseline` build and do the required visual testing.
